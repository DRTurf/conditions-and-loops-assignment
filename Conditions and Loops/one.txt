Conditional statements-Statements that are used to make 
decisions based on certain conditions. 
They allow the code to execute different actions 
depending on whether a specified condition evaluates to true or false.

Syntax:

if (condition) {
    // code to execute if the condition is true
} else {
    // code to execute if the condition is false
}

eg:
 if(x>5){
    console.log("Condition is true");
 }
 else{
    console.log("Condition is false");
 }
